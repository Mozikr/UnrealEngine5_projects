# UnrealEngine5_Projects
I upload my scripts, mechanics and such here.
All scripts are written in C++ and made by Blueprints.
The folders contain the code and a preview of how the script(s) work.

<h2 align="center">HangingWorlds (2023)</h2>
<p align="center">HangingWorlds is my first game created using UnrealEngine5. I wanted to learn the basics with a simple project and HangingWorlds is the result. Avoid obstacles and get the soul gem. The game is a prototype, maybe a few changes will be added in the future, who knows.
